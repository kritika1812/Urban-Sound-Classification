# Urban-Sound-Classification
I have used CNN to classify sound. This is a very classical way of sound classification as it is observed that similar type of sounds have similar spectrogram . A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of sound or other signal as they vary with time. And thus we can train a CNN network which takes these spectrogram images as input and using it tries to generalize patterns and hence classify them.
